Description: This page contains links to things I find interesting and some other miscellaneous stuff.
Note: I'm not sure where this header is supposed to go, I assume it shouldn't be directly at the top
     or else the browser might not understand this is an html file.

        The title box is outside of the frame because I found it easier to
        align the elements this way. I'm sure theres an easy way to align
        them even with it inside the frame, but I couldn't figure one out
        as quickly as I did this way, so this way is the way it is.

                Welcome to my webpage (if this counts). I was going for the Geocities
                aesthetic, but unfortunately I couldn't make the background emojis
                spin. I would have rather used a low-resolution fire gif, but I didn't
                find a good one and I thought an emoji pattern was an okay substitute.

                As far as interesting links go, I stumbled upon the<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_totalitarianism">
                wikipedia page for the concept of inverted totalitarianism</a> during the
                protests last summer, and I was surprised by how accurately Professor Wolin
                predicted the current (and continuing) state of politics in the United States.

                A table is included below to fulfill assignment requirements; I wasn't sure 
                what to fill it with but I decided a pasta alignment chart would do the job.
